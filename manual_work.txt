1. Set Up a Google Cloud Project

Youâ€™ll need to create a project in Google Cloud to access the Calendar API:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Click "Select a project" > "New Project".
Name it (e.g., "Local AI Calendar") and click "Create".
Once created, select the project from the dropdown.
Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library".
Search for "Google Calendar API", click it, and hit "Enable".


2. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

To authenticate your AI as a desktop application:

In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
Select "Desktop app" as the application type.
Name it (e.g., "AI Calendar Access") and click "Create".
Download the client_secrets.json file by clicking the download icon next to your new OAuth client ID.
Save this file securely in your project directory (e.g., C:/my-ai-project/).
